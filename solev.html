                        with a monster-filled dungeon. Humans with special abilities, called “Hunters,” fight in this
                        dungeon to earn rewards and keep the monsters out. Sung Jinwoo, the main protagonist, is known
                        as the “Weakest Hunter in All of Humanity” due to his minimal strength. After almost dying in a
                        dangerous dungeon, Jinwoo gains a unique ability from the “System,” a game-like interface that
                        allows him to level up like in an RPG. With this new power, Jinwoo transforms from the weakest
                        to one of the strongest Hunters, unraveling the mysteries behind the System, the gates, and the
                        origins of his powers while facing ever-greater threats.
