                        extraordinary powers thanks to the Book of Nine Secrets, a highly coveted ancient book. Because
                        of his powers, he becomes the target of martial arts masters and is eventually betrayed and
                        killed by his trusted disciple. However, his soul was reborn in the body of a weak noble family
                        servant named Zhuo Fan. Bound by demonic magic and the boy's memories, Zhuo Fan must serve the
                        young lady of the Luo Family while plotting his resurrection. With his wits, strategy, and past
                        experience, he seeks to lift this nearly ruined family back to the pinnacle of power on the
                        continent, while facing political intrigue, powerful enemies, and the secrets of his past.
